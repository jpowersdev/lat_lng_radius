# Lat/Lng/Radius

This is the rust source code for [@jpowersdev/lat_lng_radius](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jpowersdev/lat_lng_radius) npm package that I published a few months back.

It's incredibly simple. This was more an excuse to learn some Rust than it was an exercise in precision. If there are issues with the function, please [open an issue](https://github.com/jpowersdev/lat_lng_radius/issues).

The bundled wasm/ts files are in the `/pkg` folder, along with instructions for use.
